        <h4 id="intro" style="font-family:Tahoma;"><u>Hello Haru!</u></h4>
        <p class="article-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horses are wonderful creatures, they serve a lot of purpose and also help the human race on transportation, and also things like companionship and even therapy. There are also horses that serves their purpose for racing and entertainment. These racing horses are valued by the amount of wins they have in their whole life, even selectively breeding those who had a lot of race wins to make a "perfect" horse for racing. Race horses that don't win a lot have little to no value to begin with, and that becomes the opposite with the horse named "<b>Haru Urara</b>", a horse that was given the title "<b>The Shining Star of Losers Everywhere</b>". I never thought that a horse that I never met will inspire me at the start of my college life, a horse that thought me to never give up even when things get tough, this is Haru Urara, the worst, and yet, also the best Race Horse that ever existed. </p>
   <br>
   <h4 id="body"><u>Good luck Haru!</u></h4>
      <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For starters, Haru Urara is a race horse from Matha farm in Japan, she is a mare and her parents are Nippo Teio, her father, and Heroine, her mother. She started racing at November 17, 1998 in Kochi Racecourse, but managed to finish the race without winning, this lose continued on for several years until the Japanese media shared her story with an 80-lose streak and 0 wins, basically turning her into a national symbol of perseverance. This lose streak continued until <i>August 2004</i>, the date of her last race, where she still lost, giving her the standing of 0 wins and 113 loses in her whole racing career. "Maybe racing isn't really for her", that's what a lot of people have been thinking at first, but despite that, she and her jockey, Yutaka Take, still persevered even through the continuous lose streak of Haru Urara. </p>
     
     
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, I didn't really knew her the time I was born, I actually just managed to learn about her and her entire career last year when the game called "Uma Musume: Pretty Derby" gets released in global. This game features horses that are turned into anime girls which where they'll simulate a horse race (or somewhat like a track and field since they look like humans after all) in game and then you'll take part of it by being their trainer in game, I myself had a thrilling experience with it, and that's where I saw Haru Urara, a small, yet, adorable and cute horse girl, so I tried to train her in game. Even in the game, her character is very optimistic, and even the NPCs praise her for being positive all the time, and so, she started her career in game by me being her trainer. As her trainer, I managed to get her a couple of wins which where she became happy, and then there was a race called "Arima Kinen", Haru Urara didn't really met the requirements required for the race since its very long, and Haru Urara can only handle short distances since she gets very tired very quickly. But despite that, her fans and herself still tried to get an entry into the raise just so she can try, so she managed to enter the race. As her trainer, I did my best to train her, but to be expected, she lost, of course she's fine since its just a lost right? No, after the race, her dialogues were pretty sad, saying, "Why am I crying? I had so much fun." while frowning. That... that line broke my heart even as a guy that doesn't get too emotional in real life, that's where I realize that I can relate to Haru Urara myself, that even though I try my best, I can't manage to win, I always lose in life, and yet I try to laugh and smile at it... That was where I realized, Haru is basically... me.
      </p>
       
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I managed to end her story with a hole in my heart, as that line struck me like a harpoon, so I repeated her story again, trying to win that race called "Arima Kinen", and still lost, her place is as the same as before, 16th place of all the 16 racers, I was losing hope because she went to the finish line 5-10 seconds after all of the other racers passed the finish line. but of course, I can't do that, I can't lose hope, everytime I managed to finish all of my assignments and projects, I play this game just to try and give it a shot in Arima Kinen, I lost, and I lost, and I lost a couple of few more times... Maybe I should give up, I think the game really doesn't want you to win with Haru Urara in Arima Kinen, I said to myself, and then I saw the pictures of her saying "Never give up!", so I continued and tried to persevere, until... Haru Urara did it, she managed to win the Arima Kinen by my guidance even though she was not supposed to win it in the first place! I was filled with glee as I managed to finish it with my favorite character winning, while she is just standing at the screen being like the little old her. This event, gave me a chance, a hope to continue life even though how hard and messed up it is, Haru Urara became my savior. Everytime I feel down, i just try to motivate myself by saying "Haru wouldn't act like this", so I tried to smile as often as possible even though I am very sad that moment. Thanks to Haru Urara, I managed to cope and give myself hope to try again even after failing.
   </p>

   <h4 id="conclusion"><u>Goodbye Haru!</u></h4>
      <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe that was brief, but that explained how Haru Urara change my life as a whole, giving me a lot more positive vibes than before. On September 9, 2025, Haru Urara passed away from colic, I was very saddened when I heard the news as she is the one that made me happy and positive in my worst time. I even shed tears for her and even asked myself, "Why am I crying for just a horse I didn't even met in real life?". Even though I didn't managed to see her myself, I am very happy that she existed to inspire a lot of people even she's just a racehorse... No, she's not just a racehorse, she's <b>The Shining Star of Losers Everywhere.</b>
