        <h4 id="intro" style="font-family:Tahoma;"><u>Help of AI</u></h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI... A lot of AI technologies were made to help people do their jobs and entertain them by the form of a game, or entertainment applications. Their whole existence is to improve life, and "improve", they did. A lot of people nowadays rely on AI to fo their work or activities, and I, personally witnessed this myself everytime there's a problem, we don't consult a doctor anymore, we'd rather ask it on the internet, poweered by AI itself, do we have a lot of assignments? <u>ChatGPT</u> is there to do the "helping", and this became too common this age to the point that sometimes you cannot distinguish if its made by AI or not, if this is entirely manmade, or made by a machine. I personally used AI platforms myself, and while this is very helpful to both my studies and daily life, overreliance on Artificial Intelligence is very bad for you, as a human being, and also as a working part of the society.</p>
     <br>
     <h4 id="body" style="font-family:Tahoma;"><u>More AI Content</u></h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence started to improve ever since the start of the <b>pandemic</b>, with that said, living before the pandemic was a lot better, as everyone still knows how to handle things on their own, until AI became mainstream, ruining how the world normally works free from AI, ruining the world's economy as the jobs people apllies onto became closed and is managed by Artificial Intelligence instead of an actual human-being. This became a trend and until now, everything is going south as even pictures or portraits of people become AI generated.In this point of time, AI is used worldwide, affecting the lives of every human-being. In a lot of platforms we use, Artificial Intelligence can be seen, whether from artworks, videos, pictures, and a lot of mediums that can be seen online. These mediums leaves those who are digitally illiterate from distinguishing what is AI or not. With this said, a lot of artists including me and my friends are getting overwhelmed by artworks made by AI, making artists stop from creating content as Artificial Intelligence are used to create artworks instead of paying for some real artist commissions. What's more is the artworks of AI becomes better as the year goes on, making a big difference from improvement in terms of art and how they "<i>draw</i>" the prompt the client has sent them.

   <h4 id="conclusion" style="font-family:Tahoma;"><u>Confusion due to AI</u></h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Artificial Intelligence is now prevalent in a lot of sides in the world, leaving a lot of people confused on what's real or not. But to no afford, we cannot change the world we are living in as a lot of people rely now on AI to do a lot of things and losing it will do more harm than any good to humans. The only thing that we can do now is to watch and see it improve and how will it bite our backs the moment it becomes an <b>unstoppable force</b>. Just remember that we can rely on AI, but do not abuse it. Stay natural and always try to figure out things yourself without Artificial Intelligence.
