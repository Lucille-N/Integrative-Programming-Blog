        <h4 id="intro"><u>Future?</u></h4>
        <p class="article-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of us are interested to our <i>future selves</i>, and that includes me as well. We already delved in the past and also in the present, now we're going to talk about the future. Future is an inevitable progress to all of us, whether for better or for worse. So what is my plan for the future? All I can think of is to become a successful and employed game developer to create and develop games that will serve as a foundation for every other games that will be made in the future.</p>
   <br>
   <h4 id="body"><u>But why?</u></h4>
        <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why Game Development? A question a lot may ask. I think I would be a lot successful if I continued my <b>passion</b>, as a programmer that would either apply to a good company or work as an indie developer. Although this comes with a risk thanks to <u>Artificial Intelligence</u>, the moment I graduate, that's probably the peak of Artificial Intelligence replacing the jobs of humans. This is a major problem for me, knowing that after graduating, I would find a job, and due to machines replacing us, I would probably have small to no luck finding one. A continuation plan to this is trying to find jobs in advance, giving me extra time for my job search. Lastly, if I got extra money, I would continue studying and get a masteral if possible so I can get a lot of job opportunities too.
</p>
   <br>
   <h4 id="conclusion"><u>Overall Plans</u></h4>
        <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would try to be successful studying and work diligently until I become a certified <b>game developer</b> that can make good games. Even with the hardships, I will continue pursuing my dreams as it would benefit me and my family. I plan to help my brother study too by paying for his tuition when the time comes. Those who want to be successful should plan ahead for their future.</b></p>
