      <h3 id="intro" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Back when I was a Child...</h3>
      <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was but a wee child back then, a kid that has no experience with anything at all, I am Louiegie Roldan, a child that was inexperienced and yet tried to partake any contests that were available back when I was in Kindergarten. I became a student in <i>King Solomon Christian School International</i>, a private school that is just a walking distance, this is probably the "prestigious" school in our barangay back then. When I got enrolled, in my first school year, I had to participate in my first contest which is a Speaking Contest where I managed to win and got my first trophy. This said trophy was as tall as me when I was just a child, I was surprised and also pleased that I won the first place in the said contest even though I had little to no experience, given that we were just in Kinder. When I was in prep, I entered a Quiz Bee where I again, won the first place, everything was looking well back then, Mathematics were just small numbers, we only had to study addition and subtraction, nothing more. We just painted a lot of things with some water based paint and enjoyed school, listened through a lot of stories with moral lessons and a lot of other things that made me happy. As far as I know I'm very social with my friends, they let me play with them inside their houses and vice versa, it was quite a fun time. Elementary came and new faces came around, still as social as ever, and naughty too. Our Mathematics became a bit harder but its still numbers, we studied division and multiplication, and other things like fractions, this topic is also my favorite one. My favorite subject back then was Science, since the human anatomy made me interested in a lot of scientific things such as our brain and eyes. I continued competing with other students and met my rival and also best friend which also excels at both speaking contests and in his classes, although we had a bit of misunderstanding back then to the point that we cut each other off for just a small reason. I enjoyed how we just started playing card games like Yu-Gi-Oh!, buying some on the nearest sari-sari store at our school, we had no idea how does it work but we just play around with it like we know what we are doing even though we don't. This was also where I got to experience team competitions in quiz bees and also Mathematics contests like in MathScore. Mathscore is a website which where we try to learn math in a playful and creative way, this included <i><b>EduFighter</b></i>, a game where you are inside a spaceship and need to basically answer the Mathematical questions to fire the spaceship's cannon, repair it, stabilize it, and load its ammunition, a perfect way to improve my relationship with my classmates in that time. In elementary, I was also the student with the highest grade, not just in our class, but also in our whole batch, which made me feel pressured for the first time. I had to maintain that standing or else my parents wouldn't be proud to me, that's what I said to myself. The day had come and someone managed to get a higher grade than me, it was that rival that I mentioned earlier, I had no idea what to feel that time because it was the first time I got passed by someone in terms of academics, it felt like everyone's looking at me and judging me. I studied hard and took back the standing I had before, which gave me motivation to study a lot more. We also had a camping and retreat, both which happened inside of the school which is kind of boring but I still enjoyed it thanks to my friends. I also took an entrance exam in University of Santo Tomas to prepare for my high school days and fortunately passed. After that, I left King Solomon Christian School International the next school year to start my high school life.

   <h3 id="body" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The Teenage Past</h3>
      <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teenage years began at high school, I entered University of Santo Tomas to study for 4 years. My Junior High School years had a great start, there was an event where they would announce the top 10 entrance examinees who passed and has the highest score, they suddenly said my name and I stood up on stage. I was the top 4 highest scorer in that entrance exam, granting me scholarship that provides half my tuition fee for my whole Junior High School days unless I wasn't able to maintain my grades. There were too many good students in the class, to the point that when the first quarter's top 10 got announced, I got disappointed. I was not in the list of top 10, and that is where my grades went spiral. My line of 9s became 8s, I got overwhelmed. This led to the removal of my scholarship, and also my determination to study, little did I know that it has only begun. When I was in grade 8, there was an announcement that mentioned the suspension of classes for the whole week, I was happy at first because atleast I could rest for a bit. The whole week suspension became a whole month, and the whole month became a whole year. It was the pandemic that damaged me forever, <u><i>COVID-19</i></u>. Being inside the house, not seeing and getting any direct sunlight for 2 years was not a part of my checklist, and that made me depressed and sad the whole time. I did not passed a lot of activities on time, and got a lot more stressed during the whole quarantine. This continued until grade 10's recognition day, I went to school like the time has skipped, a lot of my classmates look different now, and I changed too. We moved up to Senior High School like nothing happened, and that was also the time I changed universities and entered University of The East Manila. My Senior High School was weird, half of our first school year was online, and half was face to face. I met a lot of friends and all of them had different attitudes and wavelengths, which led to a lot of misunderstandings. I also remembered when our activities included <u>Learning Activity Sheets</u> (<b>LAS</b>), these activities made us write our activities from start to bottom. The last thing that is memorable for me during Senior High School is our Senior's Ball where we managed to dance a lot and had fun, it served as our year ender before we graduated. While the time was short, I had a bit of fun in Senior High School, which lightened up my mood a bit. I stayed in University of The East Manila for college and went into Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

   <h3 id="conclusion" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The Unwavering College of Today</h3>
      <p class="article-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a rough start in college, although I managed to pass and get another scholarship from <b>DOST</b> to help my parents financially. It started easy, with the basic and common knowledge that everyone managed to learn in their past experiences in elementary or high school. Our programming language started with Python, the language is easy to understand at first but had me confused at the iterations and arrays. I made a lot of friend groups at the first semester, although in that point of time, I loved being alone most of the time thanks to the pandemic. I managed to pass all of my subjects and it feels like I'm getting back to business, I didn't had any late submissions and passed my activities on time. First semester was finished in a flash, second semester however, started with Analysis 1. Analysis 1 was one of the worst subjects that I have encountered before, I cannot understand a thing and I had to resort to reviewing online instead of just taking notes. I almost failed in this subject but luckily the questions were easy at the Finals examination so I managed to pass. The first year was done and no major issues were encountered by that time except Analysis 1. Now, I'm on second year college, the first semester had begun, and I thought Analysis 1 was the worst subject that I will encounter my whole life... Analysis 2 came in to prove me wrong. Of all the subjects, I managed to get a failing grade in Analysis 2, I had to study overtime to pass it, but it was no joke. Meanwhile while the first semester is undergoing, I applied to Research and Development Unit to furthermore deepen my knowledge about programming and also become a lot more responsible as a student. I did quite a few researches here and there but nothing more than that as I am still one of the juniors in the team. I had fun at the organization up until the finals of my first semester. Our grades have been released, and I managed to barely pass in Analysis 2 thankfully. The problem here is there is a catch because I "barely" managed to pass my grade in Analysis 2, this means I'm going to get removed in the Research and Development Unit because of my low grades. The overall requirement for retaining the membership in Research and Development Unit is atleast 2.0 or higher, but I got 3.0 in Analysis 2. I had to say my goodbyes to the team and now we're at the start of second semester. My first impression is this semester will be hard due to a lot of subjects and a lot of team building activities. Lastly, I hope that this semester will be a lot more fun than the last semester because of the said team building too.
